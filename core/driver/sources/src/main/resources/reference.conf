    // `plugins` array contains IntelliJ plugins which should be installed and enabled on IntelliJ run. Here you can add
    // your IntelliJ plugin for tests (amongst other plugins). There are a few ways to provide a proper entry pointing
    // to a plugin:
    // 1. By using a direct URI pointing to the plugin (could be from a website or from a local file). For example:
    #     { uri = "https://packages.jetbrains.team/maven/p/ij/intellij-dependencies/com/intellij/remoterobot/robot-server-plugin/0.11.15/robot-server-plugin/0.11.15.zip" }
    // 2. By using default IntelliJ plugins repository (see `probe.resolvers.plugins.repository.uri`) with additional
    //    id (pluginId), version and (optional) channel parameters which is translated into a URL with a query string.
    //    For example:
    #       { id = "org.intellij.scala", version = "2020.3.369", channel = "nightly" }
    //      will be resolved into following URL with query string (from where ide-probe should download the plugin):
    //      https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/download?pluginId=org.intellij.scala&version=2020.3.369&channel=nightly
    //    and without the optional "channel" parameter:
    #       { id = "org.intellij.scala", version = "2020.3.369" }
    //      will be resolved into following URL with query string (from where ide-probe should download the plugin):
    //      https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/download?pluginId=org.intellij.scala&version=2020.3.369
    // 3. By using a bundled IntelliJ plugin. Such plugin should be bundled in your project as a module/subproject and
    //    available on the classpath when IntelliJ instance should run. For example - such plugin subproject should be
    //    built and published to a `target` directory before performing tests (during compilation).
    //    There are two ways to point to a bundled IntelliJ plugin:
    //    a) By providing plugin's resource file name (probably plugin subproject's name followed by version and file extension).
    //       For example:
    #        { bundle = "driver-test-plugin_2.13-0.45.0-SNAPSHOT.zip" }
    //       whch will be resolved properly if mentioned .zip file is available on the classpath.
    //    b) By providing three values realted to the plugin: name, scalaVersion (major) and version. For example:
    #        { bundle = "driver-test-plugin", scalaVersion = "2.13", version = "0.45.0-SNAPSHOT" }
    //       which will be resolved the same as the earlier example (so, `.zip` extension is th default one).
    plugins = []

    // `version.release` is the "Version" and connected `version.build` is the "Build Number" of IntelliJ IDEA version.
    // You can search for proper string pairs here:
    // https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/releases/ under "com.jetbrains.intellij.idea" heading.
    // Moreover - builds from https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/snapshots/ can be used by default as well.
    // If you want to change the default intellij version, provide both parameters in your .conf file.
    // Notes:
    // - `version.release` takes precedence over `version.build`. If both values point to two different builds, then
    //    `version.release`- related build will be used.
    // - It is allowed to provide only one of two values (build or release). In order to do so, you have to
    //    do as follows. If you want to specify only the `version.release` string - you can just do it and your version
    //    will be used. If you want to specify only the `version.build` string - you have to additionally override
    //    `version.release` and set it to a `null` value. Nevertheless, best if you provide both values that match
    //    because ide-probe uses `version.release` to choose the version and `version.build` number
    //    for naming cache directories etc.
    version {
      build = "212.5080.55"
      release = "2021.2.1"

      // `ext` stands for the file extension (file format). This config specifies which extension should be
      // downloaded and installed. By default, ".zip" distributions of IntelliJ IDEA are downloaded. For now
      // two extensions are supported: ".zip" and ".dmg". ".zip" is the default one whereas ".dmg" should be used
      // for Mac OS X only.
      ext = ".zip"
      # ext = ".dmg"

    }

    // Use `path` config with proper path if you want to use an existing Intellij instead of downloading a version.
    // Example path from IntelliJ installed on macOs:
    # path = "/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app/Contents"

  }

  // `workspace` is for `Option[org.virtuslab.ideprobe.config.WorkspaceConfig]` - default None,
  // hence comments added as a reference. You can specify the workspace by using the below configurations.
  # workspace {

  // First option is to use a Default workspace - by just specifying `probe.workspace.path` with a valid string.
  //
  // `probe.workspace.path` can point to:
  // a) a directory on the filesystem:
  // `probe.workspace.path = "file://home/foo/bar"`
  // b) a directory within a jar:
  // `probe.workspace.path = "jar:file://foo.jar!/bar/baz"`
  // c) a directory on the classpath:
  // `probe.workspace.path = "classpath:/foo/bar"`
  // d) an online resource (http/https) - which can be for example a github repository as below:
  //
  #   path = "https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete.git"

  // If `probe.workspace.path` is set and points to a git repository - you can choose one of three additional options:
  // `branch`, `tag` or `commit` - to specify the reference which should be checked out on the workspace setup.
  // Only one of them can be specified. You can as well not use any of these 3 options - in such scenario the default
  // branch will be checked out just like with a plain `git clone` command. Examples below:
  #   branch = "develop"
  #   tag = "v0.41.0"
  #   commit = "a1861fc3b70588acfa171000eb365bf75c143472"

  // Another option is to use an Existing workspace by passing a proper path to its directory
  // - use only `existing` config. In this case, `probe.workspace.path` MUST NOT be defined.
  // `probe.workspace.existing` can be used for scenarios where you want to reuse an existing workspace instead of
  // copying a workspace each time when tests run. It might be beneficial for big projects / repos.
  #   existing = "/Users/my_username/code/my_repository"
  # }

  // `resolvers` is for `org.virtuslab.ideprobe.config.DependenciesConfig.Resolvers` - default values below
  resolvers {

    // `intellij.repositories` contain patterns which should be resolved by ide-probe to download proper IntelliJ IDEA
    // edition (Community or Ultimate) from proper intelliJ repository. Words inside square brackets
    // are parts of the pattern that are replaced with proper values before download attempt. Current replacements
    // are as follows:
    //
    // "[orgPath]" -> for now it is always replaced by "com/jetbrains/intellij"
    // "[organisation]" -> for now it is always replaced by "com.jetbrains.intellij"
    // "[module]" -> for now it is always replaced by "idea"
    // "[artifact]" -> by default replaced by "ideaIC" (to use IntelliJ IDEA Community edition).
    //     You can use the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition in two ways:
    //     - either replace "[artifact]" with "ideaIU" in your pattern (change the default config)
    //     - or use `IntelliJZipResolver.ultimate` directly from your code (no need to change default config)
    // "[ext]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.ext` (".zip" by default)
    // "[revision]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.release` - or from `probe.intellij.version.build` if `release` not found
    // "[build]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.build`
    // "[version]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.release` - or from `probe.intellij.version.build` if `release` not found
    // "[release]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.release` if exists. If not - "[release]" will be replaced with
    //    the "snapshot-release" string. This replacement can be used to make sure that IntelliJ will be downloaded only
    //    based on IntelliJVersion's "release" - and NOT based on "build".
    //
    // You can use a custom intellij repository pattern(s) instead of the default ones by defining your patterns
    // in the `intellij.repositories` config.
    //
    // You can also add a custom intellij repository pattern(s) on top of the 6 default repositories, so that
    // ide-probe will first try using the IntelliJs downloaded from your repositories if present. If ide-probe doesn't
    // find the IntelliJ distribution by your patterns, it will use the default 6 repository patterns listed below.
    // To achieve that, specify a custom repository pattern and add the `official` or `default` keyword on another line.
    // Example below:
    // intellij.repositories = [
    //   "file:///"${HOME}"/.my_intellij_idea_downloads/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision][ext]",
    //   official
    // ]
    //
    // Moreover, you can add a pattern pointing to a directory of an installed IntelliJ instance instead of
    // pattern pointing to a .zip (or .dmg) file. ide-probe will recognize if the pattern points to a directory with
    // installed IntelliJ or to a .zip (or .dmg) file. For example, if you run the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier on your
    // repository (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/tools-gradle-intellij-plugin.html#tasks-runpluginverifier),
    // then you could use following configuration:
    // intellij.repositories = [
    //   "file:///"${HOME}"/.pluginVerifier/ides/IC-[revision]/",
    //   official
    // ]
    //
    // Such config will make ide-probe use an installed IntelliJ from local filesystem from the
    // ~/.pluginVerifier/ides/IC-[revision]/ directory (if exists). If it does not exist under specified path,
    // then ide-probe will download it from one of the 6 official repositories.
    //
    // Note: if you use the `intellij.repositories` config with a value pointing to an installed
    // IntelliJ instance directory - then DO NOT use the `probe.intellij.path` config in the same time.
    // The `probe.intellij.path` config takes precedence over `intellij.repositories` in such case, so the path
    // from `intellij.repositories` would be ignored.
    //
    intellij.repositories = [
      "https://download.jetbrains.com/[module]/nightly/[artifact]-[revision][ext]",

    // "[minor]" -> the "minor" part of the JBR release's version number - e.g. "b469.53" from "17.0.4b469.53"
    // "[platform]" -> value connected to the detected OS - "linux", "osx" or "windows"

    // You can define your own `jbr.repositories` if you want to use a non-standard JBR repository pattern
    // instead of the 2 standard ones defined below.
